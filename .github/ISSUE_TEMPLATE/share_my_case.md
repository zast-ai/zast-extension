### My ZAST Express Usage Case
Share how I used the extension (e.g. Assessed a Java microservice project with ZAST Express, identified 5 high-risk vulnerabilities in 3 minutes and fixed them quickly; Reduced false positive handling time by 80% for our team):

### Key Steps I Took (Optional)
Briefly list the core operations to help others replicate your experience:
1. [e.g. Configured the extension to focus on OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities]
2. [e.g. Integrated ZAST Express into our GitLab pipeline]
3. [e.g. Used the PoC feature to verify vulnerabilities before fixing]

### Results & Evidence (Optional)
Attach screenshots, data charts, or metrics to showcase the value:
- Screenshots of assessment reports, PoC verification results, or efficiency comparison
- Data (e.g. Time saved, number of vulnerabilities found, reduction in false positive rate)
- Team/Project impact (e.g. Improved security review efficiency, reduced production security incidents)

### Additional Thoughts (Optional)
Any tips, suggestions, or feedback about using ZAST Express
